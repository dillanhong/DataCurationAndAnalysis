# Data Curation And Analysis On Population Growth

**Project Goal:**
The goal of my data curation and analysis project is to compare and analyze population growth statistics of various countries or regions from 1967 to 2008. This project aims to provide insights into how populations have changed over this time period and identify any trends or variations in growth.

**Attribute Data Types and Description**  
- **column_a**
  - **Type:** Integer
  - **Description:** An identifier or index for the column.

- **country_territory**
  - **Type:** String
  - **Description:** The name of the country or territory associated with the data.

- **population_in_1967**
  - **Type:** Integer
  - **Description:** The population size for the year 1967.

- **population_in_1990**
  - **Type:** Integer
  - **Description:** The population size for the year 1990.

- **population_in_1994**
  - **Type:** Integer
  - **Description:** The population size for the year 1994.

- **population_in_2002**
  - **Type:** Integer
  - **Description:** The population size for the year 2002.

- **population_in_2008**
  - **Type:** Integer
  - **Description:** The population size for the year 2008.

- **life_expectancy_in_years_2008**
  - **Type:** Integer
  - **Description:** The life expectancy in years for the year 2008.

- **total_population_growth_from_1960s_to_2007_2011**
  - **Type:** Integer
  - **Description:** The total population growth over the period from the 1960s to 2007 or 2011, depending on the dataset. This likely represents the net change in population during this time frame.

**Analysis:**
- The count of data points is the same for both years, indicating consistent data availability.
- The mean population significantly increased from 1967 to 2008, suggesting overall population growth in these regions.
- While the mean increased, the wide standard deviations indicate that there is still substantial variation in population sizes.
- The minimum populations increased slightly, indicating that even the smallest populations grew over time.
- The median population increased significantly, confirming that the majority of regions experienced population growth.
- The maximum population in 2008 is substantially larger, signifying that some regions saw substantial population expansion.

In summary, these statistics suggest that, on average, the regions in this dataset experienced population growth from 1967 to 2008, with some regions experiencing more significant growth than others. The wide standard deviations indicate that while there is a general trend of growth, there are still regions with diverse population dynamics.

**Known and Potential Issues:**
1. **Handling Commas, Symbols, etc.:** One known issue is that the dataset contains numeric values with commas and random symbols on the website, which can interfere with numerical analysis. This issue may require data preprocessing to remove commas before conducting quantitative analysis.

2. **Data Currency:** The data is based on information available on Wikipedia, and it may not be the most up-to-date information. Population figures for countries can change over time, and this dataset may not reflect the latest demographic data. Therefore, it's essential to be aware of potential discrepancies and consider the data's age when drawing conclusions.

3. **Data Completeness:** Wikipedia data may not include information for all countries or regions, which can result in gaps in the dataset. This project should consider the limitations of the data's coverage and handle missing values appropriately.

4. **Data Quality:** Data quality can vary on Wikipedia, and discrepancies or errors might be present in the dataset. Quality assurance and validation are important steps in the data curation process to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

Addressing these issues is crucial to ensure the reliability and relevance of the project's findings.
