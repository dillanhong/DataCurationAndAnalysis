# Data Curation And Analysis On Population Growth

**Project Goal:**
The goal of my data curation and analysis project is to compare and analyze population growth statistics of various countries or regions from 1967 to 2008. This project aims to provide insights into how populations have changed over this time period and identify any trends or variations in growth.

**Known and Potential Issues:**
1. **Handling Commas, Symbols, etc.:** One known issue is that the dataset contains numeric values with commas and random symbols on the website, which can interfere with numerical analysis. This issue may require data preprocessing to remove commas before conducting quantitative analysis.

2. **Data Currency:** The data is based on information available on Wikipedia, and it may not be the most up-to-date information. Population figures for countries can change over time, and this dataset may not reflect the latest demographic data. Therefore, it's essential to be aware of potential discrepancies and consider the data's age when drawing conclusions.

3. **Data Completeness:** Wikipedia data may not include information for all countries or regions, which can result in gaps in the dataset. This project should consider the limitations of the data's coverage and handle missing values appropriately.

4. **Data Quality:** Data quality can vary on Wikipedia, and discrepancies or errors might be present in the dataset. Quality assurance and validation are important steps in the data curation process to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

Addressing these issues is crucial to ensure the reliability and relevance of the project's findings.
